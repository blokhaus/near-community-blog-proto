Write your blog post in this area, replacing this txt.

You can **drag and drop images right into this box**. GitHub will upload them and give you a working image URL. Up to three images are supported -- one for the featuredImage and two for use in your blog post.

Copy the image links into the frontmatter (for `featuredImage`) or into the post body, like this:

![Your description of the image goes here](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abc123-image-1)

> ⚠️ Supported image types: `.png` and `.jpg` (other types may not be validated correctly)
