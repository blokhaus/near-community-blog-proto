        <summary>📌 What is frontmatter? (Click to expand)</summary>

        Frontmatter is a short block of info at the top of your post that helps categorize and publish it.

        You **must** include this in your post (keep the `---` lines):

        ```yaml
        ---
        title: "Why I Love NEAR"
        description: "Exploring what makes NEAR unique and powerful for builders"
        author: "Jane Doe"
        subject: "Community"
        featuredImage: "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/.../featured-near.png"
        submission: true
        ---
        ```

        ✅ This should come before any headings or body content.
