## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Submit a Blog Post

Anyone with a GitHub account can submit a blog post by opening a [new issue](../../issues/new/choose) and selecting the **‚ÄúSubmit a Blog Post‚Äù** template.

Your submission will need to include:

- A title and short description
- Your name (or author handle)
- A topic category (selected from a list)
- A featured image URL
- Your article content in Markdown format

üõ† The system will automatically validate your submission. If it passes, a pull request will be created for editorial review.

---

## üîÅ Submission Lifecycle

1. **A user opens an Issue** using the provided template
2. **Validation scripts** check your input and content format
3. **If valid**, a pull request (PR) is automatically created
4. **Approvers review** the content in the PR
5. **If approved**, the PR is merged and the article is published live on the NEAR website

üóÇÔ∏è Finalized content lives in content/posts/, ready for consumption by the frontend.
