We’re excited to introduce a new initiative on the NEAR website: the NEAR Community Blog — a space where anyone in the NEAR ecosystem can share their ideas, insights, and stories about the NEAR protocol, NEAR AI, and the future of a decentralized, user-owned internet.

The NEAR ecosystem has always been shaped by the contributions of its builders, researchers, and curious minds around the world. With this new blog, we’re making it easier than ever for the community to share knowledge, start conversations, and surface important perspectives on where NEAR — and the decentralized web — are headed.

### Open to All
The NEAR Community Blog is open to anyone with a GitHub account. Whether you're a developer building on NEAR, a researcher exploring zero-knowledge proofs, an artist using Shade Agents to launch creative projects, or just someone with a strong opinion about the decentralized future, we want to hear from you.
Submissions are handled via GitHub — just open an issue in our community blog repository (link coming soon), and follow the simple template to propose your post. You don’t need to write perfect prose or be a professional author. Clear, honest, and thoughtful contributions are what we're after.

### What to Write About
We’re especially interested in blog posts that explore:
- New tools, protocols, or dApps in the NEAR ecosystem
- NEAR AI and the implications of user-owned, decentralized artificial intelligence
- Reflections on the evolving role of crypto in the global economy
- Tutorials and explainers that help others understand how to build on NEAR
- Opinions on governance, privacy, and the future of Web3
- Personal stories from builders, creators, and community members working with NEAR tech

If it’s about NEAR and it contributes to the larger conversation about open, trustless systems, it’s welcome.

### Built in the Open
In true NEAR fashion, the community blog process is transparent and open source. You’ll be able to see what others are working on, get feedback, and improve your submission with help from maintainers. Once approved, posts will be published on the NEAR website, credited to you, and shared with the broader ecosystem.

We believe this is one small but powerful step toward making NEAR not just a protocol, but a living, breathing community — one that documents its progress in public, learns together, and celebrates diverse voices and perspectives.

Whether you want to write a deep technical guide, share a vision for decentralized AI, or just express what NEAR means to you, this blog is for you.

Start drafting — we can’t wait to read what you write.
